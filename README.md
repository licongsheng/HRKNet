This study introduces a new deep sequence model based on Koopman theory, named HRKNet, designed for heart rate (HR) measurement using frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. The HRKNet model comprises multiple Koopman blocks, which include the Fourier filter, time-invariant Koopman predictor (KP), and time-variant KP. The Fourier filter employs frequency-domain statistical techniques to differentiate between time-invariant and time-variant components. The time-invariant KP processes time-invariant dynamics through the global learning operator, whereas the time-variant KP manages time-variant dynamics using the local computation operator within the backtracking window and produces a fitted input. The model then outputs the aggregated predictions from all blocks. Validation of the model is carried out using data from various scenarios.
